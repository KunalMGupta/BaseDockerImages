# BaseDockerImages

Base Docker Images build on top of NVIDIA CUDA XX.X and includes anaconda, other useful packages. 

This repo now supports code-server also, so you get to enjoy all the cool features of VS code inside the docker! This was made possible primariy by scavenging the awesome repo https://github.com/works-on-my-machine/pytorch-code-server . So please check that out as well if you found this repo useful.
